It also provides a simple validator chaining mechanism by which multiple validators may be applied to a single datum in a user-defined order. What is a validator? A validator examines its input with respect to some requirements and produces a boolean result indicating whether the input successfully validates against the requirements. If the input does not meet the requirements, a validator may additionally provide information about which requirement(s) the input does not meet. For example, a web application might require that a username be between six and twelve characters in length, and may only contain alphanumeric characters. A validator can be used for ensuring that a username meets these requirements. If a chosen username does not meet one or both of the requirements, it would be useful to know which of the requirements the username fails to meet. Basic usage of validators Having defined validation in this way provides the foundation for Zend\\Validator\\ValidatorInterface , which defines two methods, isValid() and getMessages() . The isValid() method performs validation upon the provided value, returning true if and only if the value passes against the validation criteria. If isValid() returns false , the getMessages() method will return an array of messages explaining the reason(s) for validation failure. The array keys are short strings that identify the reasons for validation failure, and the array values are the corresponding human-readable string messages. The keys and values are class-dependent; each validation class defines its own set of validation failure messages and the unique keys that identify them. Each class also has a const definition that matches each identifier for a validation failure cause. Stateful validators The getMessages() methods return validation failure information only for the most recent isValid() call. Each call to isValid() clears any messages and errors caused by a previous isValid() call, because it's likely that each call to isValid() is made for a different input value. The following example illustrates validation of an e-mail address: use Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress; $validator = new EmailAddress(); if ($validator->isValid($email)) { // email appears to be valid } else { // email is invalid; print the reasons foreach ($validator->getMessages() as $messageId => $message) { printf(\"Validation failure '%s': %s\\n\", $messageId, $message); } } Customizing messages Validator classes provide a setMessage() method with which you can specify the format of a message returned by getMessages() in case of validation failure. The first argument of this method is a string containing the error message. You can include tokens in this string which will be substituted with data relevant to the validator. The token %value% is supported by all validators; this is substituted with the value you passed to isValid() . Other tokens may be supported on a case-by-case basis in each validation class. For example, %max% is a token supported by Zend\\Validator\\LessThan . The getMessageVariables() method returns an array of variable tokens supported by the validator. The second optional argument is a string that identifies the validation failure message template to be set, which is useful when a validation class defines more than one cause for failure. If you omit the second argument, setMessage() assumes the message you specify should be used for the first message template declared in the validation class. Many validation classes only have one error message template defined, so there is no need to specify which message template you are changing. use Zend\\Validator\\StringLength; $validator = new StringLength(8); $validator->setMessage( 'The string \\'%value%\\' is too short; it must be at least %min% characters', StringLength::TOO_SHORT ); if (! $validator->isValid('word')) { $messages = $validator->getMessages(); echo current($messages); // \"The string 'word' is too short; it must be at least 8 characters\" } You can set multiple messages using the setMessages() method. Its argument is an array containing key/message pairs. use Zend\\Validator\\StringLength; $validator = new StringLength(['min' => 8, 'max' => 12]); $validator->setMessages([ StringLength::TOO_SHORT => 'The string \\'%value%\\' is too short', StringLength::TOO_LONG => 'The string \\'%value%\\' is too long', ]); If your application requires even greater flexibility with which it reports validation failures, you can access properties by the same name as the message tokens supported by a given validation class. The value property is always available in a validator; it is the value you specified as the argument of isValid() . Other properties may be supported on a case-by-case basis in each validation class. use Zend\\Validator\\StringLength; $validator = new StringLength(['min' => 8, 'max' => 12]); if (! $validator->isValid('word')) { printf( \"Word failed: %s; its length is not between %d and %d\\n\", $validator->value, $validator->min, $validator->max ); } Translating messages Installation requirements The translation of validator messages depends on the zend-i18n component, so be sure to have it installed before getting started: $$$$FENCED_CODE_BLOCK_5db336b6ad91c8.16244457 Validator classes provide a setTranslator() method with which you can specify an instance of Zend\\Validator\\Translator\\TranslatorInterface which will translate the messages in case of a validation failure. The getTranslator() method returns the translator instance. Zend\\Mvc\\I18n\\Translator provides an implementation compatible with the validator component. use Zend\\Mvc\\I18n\\Translator; use Zend\\Validator\\StringLength; $validator = new StringLength(['min' => 8, 'max' => 12]); $translate = new Translator(); // configure the translator... $validator->setTranslator($translate); With the static AbstractValidator::setDefaultTranslator() method you can set a instance of Zend\\Validator\\Translator\\TranslatorInterface which will be used for all validation classes, and can be retrieved with getDefaultTranslator() . This prevents the need for setting a translator manually with each validator. use Zend\\Mvc\\I18n\\Translator; use Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator; $translate = new Translator(); // configure the translator... AbstractValidator::setDefaultTranslator($translate); Sometimes it is necessary to disable the translator within a validator. To achieve this you can use the setDisableTranslator() method, which accepts a boolean parameter, and isTranslatorDisabled() to get the set value. use Zend\\Validator\\StringLength; $validator = new StringLength(['min' => 8, 'max' => 12]); if (! $validator->isTranslatorDisabled()) { $validator->setDisableTranslator(); } It is also possible to use a translator instead of setting own messages with setMessage() . But doing so, you should keep in mind, that the translator works also on messages you set your own. Translation compatibility In versions 2.0 - 2.1, Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator implemented Zend\\I18n\\Translator\\TranslatorAwareInterface and accepted instances of Zend\\I18n\\Translator\\Translator . Starting in version 2.2.0, zend-validator now defines a translator interface, > Zend\\Validator\\Translator\\TranslatorInterface , as well as it's own -aware variant, > Zend\\Validator\\Translator\\TranslatorAwareInterface . This was done to reduce dependencies for the component, and follows the principal of Separated Interfaces. The upshot is that if you are migrating from a pre-2.2 version, and receiving errors indicating that the translator provided does not implement Zend\\Validator\\Translator\\TranslatorInterface , you will need to make a change to your code. An implementation of Zend\\Validator\\Translator\\TranslatorInterface is provided in Zend\\Mvc\\I18n\\Translator , which also extends Zend\\I18n\\Translator\\Translator . This version can be instantiated and used just as the original Zend\\I18n version. A new service has also been registered with the MVC, MvcTranslator , which will return this specialized, bridge instance. Most users should see no issues, as Zend\\Validator\\ValidatorPluginManager has been modified to use the MvcTranslator service internally, which is how most developers were getting the translator instance into validators in the first place. You will only need to change code if you were manually injecting the instance previously.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"intro/#introduction","text":"zend-validator provides a set of commonly needed validators.

You can use this information to set your own messages, or to translate existing messages which a validator could return to something different. Validation messages are defined as constant/template pairs, with the constant representing a translation key. Such constants are defined per-class. Let's look into Zend\\Validator\\GreaterThan for a descriptive example: protected $messageTemplates = [ self::NOT_GREATER => \"'%value%' is not greater than '%min%'\", ]; The constant self::NOT_GREATER refers to the failure and is used as the message key, and the message template itself is used as the value within the message array. You can retrieve all message templates from a validator by using the getMessageTemplates() method. It returns the above array containing all messages a validator could return in the case of a failed validation. $validator = new Zend\\Validator\\GreaterThan(); $messages = $validator->getMessageTemplates(); Using the setMessage() method you can set another message to be returned in case of the specified failure. use Zend\\Validator\\GreaterThan; $validator = new GreaterThan(); $validator->setMessage('Please enter a lower value', GreaterThan::NOT_GREATER); The second parameter defines the failure which will be overridden. When you omit this parameter, then the given message will be set for all possible failures of this validator. Using pre-translated validation messages zend-validator is shipped with more than 45 different validators with more than 200 failure messages. It can be a tedious task to translate all of these messages. For your convenience, pre-translated messages are provided in the zendframework/zend-i18n-resources package: $ composer require zendframework/zend-i18n-resources To translate all validation messages to German for example, attach a translator to Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator using these resource files. use Zend\\I18n\\Translator\\Resources; use Zend\\Mvc\\I18n\\Translator; use Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator; $translator = new Zend\\Mvc\\I18n\\Translator(); $translator->addTranslationFilePattern( 'phpArray', Resources::getBasePath(), Resources::getPatternForValidator() ); AbstractValidator::setDefaultTranslator($translator); Supported languages The supported languages may not be complete. New languages will be added with each release. Additionally feel free to use the existing resource files to make your own translations. You could also use these resource files to rewrite existing translations. So you are not in need to create these files manually yourself. Limit the size of a validation message Sometimes it is necessary to limit the maximum size a validation message can have; as an example, when your view allows a maximum size of 100 chars to be rendered on one line. To enable this, Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator is able to automatically limit the maximum returned size of a validation message. To get the actual set size use Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator::getMessageLength() . If it is -1 , then the returned message will not be truncated. This is default behaviour. To limit the returned message size, use Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator::setMessageLength() . Set it to any integer size you need. When the returned message exceeds the set size, then the message will be truncated and the string **...** will be added instead of the rest of the message.

The following code demonstrates a way to solve the example from the introduction , where a username must be between 6 and 12 alphanumeric characters: use Zend\\I18n\\Validator\\Alnum; use Zend\\Validator\\StringLength; use Zend\\Validator\\ValidatorChain; // Create a validator chain and add validators to it $validatorChain = new ValidatorChain(); $validatorChain->attach(new StringLength(['min' => 6, 'max' => 12])); $validatorChain->attach(new Alnum()); // Validate the username if ($validatorChain->isValid($username)) { // username passed validation } else { // username failed validation; print reasons foreach ($validatorChain->getMessages() as $message) { echo \"$message\\n\"; } } Validators are run in the order they were added to the ValidatorChain . In the above example, the username is first checked to ensure that its length is between 6 and 12 characters, and then it is checked to ensure that it contains only alphanumeric characters. The second validation, for alphanumeric characters, is performed regardless of whether the first validation, for length between 6 and 12 characters, succeeds. This means that if both validations fail, getMessages() will return failure messages from both validators. In some cases, it makes sense to have a validator break the chain if its validation process fails. ValidatorChain supports such use cases with the second parameter to the attach() method. By setting $breakChainOnFailure to true , if the validator fails, it will short-circuit execution of the chain, preventing subsequent validators from executing. If the above example were written as follows, then the alphanumeric validation would not occur if the string length validation fails: $chain->attach(new StringLength(['min' => 6, 'max' => 12]), true); $chain->attach(new Alnum()); Any object that implements Zend\\Validator\\ValidatorInterface may be used in a validator chain. Setting Validator Chain Order For each validator added to the ValidatorChain , you can set a priority to define the chain order. The default value is 1 . Higher values indicate earlier execution, while lower values execute later; use negative values to force late execution. In the following example, the username is first checked to ensure that its length is between 7 and 9 characters, and then it is checked to ensure that its length is between 3 and 5 characters. use Zend\\I18n\\Validator\\Alnum; use Zend\\Validator\\StringLength; use Zend\\Validator\\ValidatorChain; $username = 'ABCDFE'; // Create a validator chain and add validators to it $validatorChain = new ValidatorChain(); $validatorChain->attach( new StringLength(['min' => 3, 'max' => 5]), true, // break chain on failure 1 ); $validatorChain->attach( new StringLength(['min' => 7, 'max' => 9]), true, // break chain on failure 2 // higher priority! ); // Validate the username if ($validatorChain->isValid($username)) { // username passed validation echo \"Success\"; } else { // username failed validation; print reasons foreach ($validatorChain->getMessages() as $message) { echo \"$message\\n\"; } } // This first example will display: The input is less than 7 characters long","title":"Validator Chains"},{"location":"validator-chains/#validator-chains","text":"","title":"Validator Chains"},{"location":"validator-chains/#basic-usage","text":"","title":"Basic Usage"},{"location":"validator-chains/#setting-validator-chain-order","text":"For each validator added to the ValidatorChain , you can set a priority to define the chain order.

The component allows this via implementations of Zend\\Validator\\ValidatorInterface . Zend\\Validator\\ValidatorInterface defines two methods: isValid() and getMessages() . An object that implements the interface may be added to a validator chain using Zend\\Validator\\ValidatorChain::addValidator() . Such objects may also be used with zend-inputfilter . Validators will return a boolean value from isValid() , and report information regarding why a value failed validation via getMessages() . The availability of the reasons for validation failures may be valuable to an application for various purposes, such as providing statistics for usability analysis. Basic validation failure message functionality is implemented in Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator , which you may extend for your custom validators. Extending class you would implement the isValid() method logic and define the message variables and message templates that correspond to the types of validation failures that can occur. If a value fails your validation tests, then isValid() should return false . If the value passes your validation tests, then isValid() should return true . In general, the isValid() method should not throw any exceptions, except where it is impossible to determine whether or not the input value is valid. A few examples of reasonable cases for throwing an exception might be if a file cannot be opened, an LDAP server could not be contacted, or a database connection is unavailable, where such a thing may be required for validation success or failure to be determined. Creating a Validation Class The following example demonstrates how a custom validator might be written. In this case, the validator tests that a value is a floating point value. namespace MyValid; use Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator; class Float extends AbstractValidator { const FLOAT = 'float'; protected $messageTemplates = [ self::FLOAT => \"'%value%' is not a floating point value\", ]; public function isValid($value) { $this->setValue($value); if (! is_float($value)) { $this->error(self::FLOAT); return false; } return true; } } The class defines a template for its single validation failure message, which includes the built-in magic parameter, %value% . The call to setValue() prepares the object to insert the tested value into the failure message automatically, should the value fail validation. The call to error() tracks a reason for validation failure. Since this class only defines one failure message, it is not necessary to provide error() with the name of the failure message template. Writing a Validation Class having Dependent Conditions The following example demonstrates a more complex set of validation rules: The input must be numeric. The input must fall within a range of boundary values. An input value would fail validation for exactly one of the following reasons: The input value is not numeric. The input value is less than the minimum allowed value. The input value is more than the maximum allowed value. These validation failure reasons are then translated to definitions in the class: namespace MyValid; use Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator; class NumericBetween extends AbstractValidator { const MSG_NUMERIC = 'msgNumeric'; const MSG_MINIMUM = 'msgMinimum'; const MSG_MAXIMUM = 'msgMaximum'; public $minimum = 0; public $maximum = 100; protected $messageVariables = [ 'min' => 'minimum', 'max' => 'maximum', ]; protected $messageTemplates = [ self::MSG_NUMERIC => \"'%value%' is not numeric\", self::MSG_MINIMUM => \"'%value%' must be at least '%min%'\", self::MSG_MAXIMUM => \"'%value%' must be no more than '%max%'\", ]; public function isValid($value) { $this->setValue($value); if (! is_numeric($value)) { $this->error(self::MSG_NUMERIC); return false; } if ($value < $this->minimum) { $this->error(self::MSG_MINIMUM); return false; } if ($value > $this->maximum) { $this->error(self::MSG_MAXIMUM); return false; } return true; } } The public properties $minimum and $maximum have been established to provide the minimum and maximum boundaries, respectively, for a value to successfully validate. The class also defines two message variables that correspond to the public properties and allow min and max to be used in message templates as magic parameters, just as with value . Note that if any one of the validation checks in isValid() fails, an appropriate failure message is prepared, and the method immediately returns false . These validation rules are therefore sequentially dependent; that is, if one test should fail, there is no need to test any subsequent validation rules. This need not be the case, however. The following example illustrates how to write a class having independent validation rules, where the validation object may return multiple reasons why a particular validation attempt failed. Validation with Independent Conditions, Multiple Reasons for Failure Consider writing a validation class for password strength enforcement - when a user is required to choose a password that meets certain criteria for helping secure user accounts. Let us assume that the password security criteria enforce that the password: is at least 8 characters in length, contains at least one uppercase letter, contains at least one lowercase letter, and contains at least one digit character. The following class implements these validation criteria: namespace MyValid; use Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator; class PasswordStrength extends AbstractValidator { const LENGTH = 'length'; const UPPER = 'upper'; const LOWER = 'lower'; const DIGIT = 'digit'; protected $messageTemplates = [ self::LENGTH => \"'%value%' must be at least 8 characters in length\", self::UPPER => \"'%value%' must contain at least one uppercase letter\", self::LOWER => \"'%value%' must contain at least one lowercase letter\", self::DIGIT => \"'%value%' must contain at least one digit character\", ]; public function isValid($value) { $this->setValue($value); $isValid = true; if (strlen($value) < 8) { $this->error(self::LENGTH); $isValid = false; } if (! preg_match('/[A-Z]/', $value)) { $this->error(self::UPPER); $isValid = false; } if (! preg_match('/[a-z]/', $value)) { $this->error(self::LOWER); $isValid = false; } if (! preg_match('/\\d/', $value)) { $this->error(self::DIGIT); $isValid = false; } return $isValid; } } Note that the four criteria tests in isValid() do not immediately return false . This allows the validation class to provide all of the reasons that the input password failed to meet the validation requirements. If, for example, a user were to input the string #$% as a password, isValid() would cause all four validation failure messages to be returned by a subsequent call to getMessages() .","title":"Writing Validators"},{"location":"writing-validators/#writing-validators","text":"zend-validator supplies a set of commonly needed validators, but many applications have needs for custom validators.

These validation failure reasons are then translated to definitions in the class: namespace MyValid; use Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator; class NumericBetween extends AbstractValidator { const MSG_NUMERIC = 'msgNumeric'; const MSG_MINIMUM = 'msgMinimum'; const MSG_MAXIMUM = 'msgMaximum'; public $minimum = 0; public $maximum = 100; protected $messageVariables = [ 'min' => 'minimum', 'max' => 'maximum', ]; protected $messageTemplates = [ self::MSG_NUMERIC => \"'%value%' is not numeric\", self::MSG_MINIMUM => \"'%value%' must be at least '%min%'\", self::MSG_MAXIMUM => \"'%value%' must be no more than '%max%'\", ]; public function isValid($value) { $this->setValue($value); if (! is_numeric($value)) { $this->error(self::MSG_NUMERIC); return false; } if ($value < $this->minimum) { $this->error(self::MSG_MINIMUM); return false; } if ($value > $this->maximum) { $this->error(self::MSG_MAXIMUM); return false; } return true; } } The public properties $minimum and $maximum have been established to provide the minimum and maximum boundaries, respectively, for a value to successfully validate. The class also defines two message variables that correspond to the public properties and allow min and max to be used in message templates as magic parameters, just as with value . Note that if any one of the validation checks in isValid() fails, an appropriate failure message is prepared, and the method immediately returns false . These validation rules are therefore sequentially dependent; that is, if one test should fail, there is no need to test any subsequent validation rules. This need not be the case, however. The following example illustrates how to write a class having independent validation rules, where the validation object may return multiple reasons why a particular validation attempt failed.","title":"Writing a Validation Class having Dependent Conditions"},{"location":"writing-validators/#validation-with-independent-conditions-multiple-reasons-for-failure","text":"Consider writing a validation class for password strength enforcement - when a user is required to choose a password that meets certain criteria for helping secure user accounts. Let us assume that the password security criteria enforce that the password: is at least 8 characters in length, contains at least one uppercase letter, contains at least one lowercase letter, and contains at least one digit character. The following class implements these validation criteria: namespace MyValid; use Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator; class PasswordStrength extends AbstractValidator { const LENGTH = 'length'; const UPPER = 'upper'; const LOWER = 'lower'; const DIGIT = 'digit'; protected $messageTemplates = [ self::LENGTH => \"'%value%' must be at least 8 characters in length\", self::UPPER => \"'%value%' must contain at least one uppercase letter\", self::LOWER => \"'%value%' must contain at least one lowercase letter\", self::DIGIT => \"'%value%' must contain at least one digit character\", ]; public function isValid($value) { $this->setValue($value); $isValid = true; if (strlen($value) < 8) { $this->error(self::LENGTH); $isValid = false; } if (! preg_match('/[A-Z]/', $value)) { $this->error(self::UPPER); $isValid = false; } if (! preg_match('/[a-z]/', $value)) { $this->error(self::LOWER); $isValid = false; } if (! preg_match('/\\d/', $value)) { $this->error(self::DIGIT); $isValid = false; } return $isValid; } } Note that the four criteria tests in isValid() do not immediately return false . This allows the validation class to provide all of the reasons that the input password failed to meet the validation requirements. If, for example, a user were to input the string #$% as a password, isValid() would cause all four validation failure messages to be returned by a subsequent call to getMessages() .","title":"Validation with Independent Conditions, Multiple Reasons for Failure"},{"location":"validators/barcode/","text":"Barcode Validator Zend\\Validator\\Barcode allows you to check if a given value can be represented as a barcode.

When the barcode is 8 chars long it includes a checksum which is calculated with modulo 10. It is commonly used with small products where a UPCA barcode would not fit. Supported options The following options are supported for Zend\\Validator\\Barcode : adapter : Sets the barcode adapter which will be used. Supported are all above noted adapters. When using a self defined adapter, then you have to set the complete class name. checksum : TRUE when the barcode should contain a checksum. The default value depends on the used adapter. Note that some adapters don't allow to set this option. options : Defines optional options for a self written adapters. Basic usage To validate if a given string is a barcode you must know its type. See the following example for an EAN13 barcode: $valid = new Zend\\Validator\\Barcode('EAN13'); if ($valid->isValid($input)) { // input appears to be valid } else { // input is invalid } Optional checksum Some barcodes can be provided with an optional checksum. These barcodes would be valid even without checksum. Still, when you provide a checksum, then you should also validate it. By default, these barcode types perform no checksum validation. By using the checksum option you can define if the checksum will be validated or ignored. $valid = new Zend\\Validator\\Barcode([ 'adapter' => 'EAN13', 'checksum' => false, ]); if ($valid->isValid($input)) { // input appears to be valid } else { // input is invalid } Reduced security by disabling checksum validation By switching off checksum validation you will also reduce the security of the used barcodes. Additionally you should note that you can also turn off the checksum validation for those barcode types which must contain a checksum value. Barcodes which would not be valid could then be returned as valid even if they are not. Writing custom adapters You may write custom barcode validators for usage with Zend\\Validator\\Barcode ; this is often necessary when dealing with proprietary barcode types. To write your own barcode validator, you need the following information. Length : The length your barcode must have. It can have one of the following values: Integer : A value greater 0, which means that the barcode must have this length. -1 : There is no limitation for the length of this barcode. \"even\" : The length of this barcode must have a even amount of digits. \"odd\" : The length of this barcode must have a odd amount of digits. array : An array of integer values. The length of this barcode must have one of the set array values. Characters : A string which contains all allowed characters for this barcode. Also the integer value 128 is allowed, which means the first 128 characters of the ASCII table. Checksum : A string which will be used as callback for a method which does the checksum validation. Your custom barcode validator must extend Zend\\Validator\\Barcode\\AbstractAdapter or implement Zend\\Validator\\Barcode\\AdapterInterface . As an example, let's create a validator that expects an even number of characters that include all digits and the letters 'ABCDE', and which requires a checksum. namespace My\\Barcode; use Zend\\Validator\\Barcode; use Zend\\Validator\\Barcode\\AbstractAdapter; class MyBar extends AbstractAdapter { protected $length = 'even'; protected $characters = '0123456789ABCDE'; protected $checksum = 'mod66'; protected function mod66($barcode) { // do some validations and return a boolean } } $valid = Barcode(MyBar::class); if ($valid->isValid($input)) { // input appears to be valid } else { // input is invalid }","title":"Barcode"},{"location":"validators/barcode/#barcode-validator","text":"Zend\\Validator\\Barcode allows you to check if a given value can be represented as a barcode.","title":"Barcode Validator"},{"location":"validators/barcode/#supported-barcodes","text":"Zend\\Validator\\Barcode supports multiple barcode standards and can be extended with proprietary barcode implementations.

A credit card contains several items of metadata, including a hologram, account number, logo, expiration date, security code, and the card holder name. The algorithms for verifying the combination of metadata are only known to the issuing company, and should be verified with them for purposes of payment. However, it's often useful to know whether or not a given number actually falls within the ranges of possible numbers prior to performing such verification, and, as such, Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard verifies that the credit card number provided is well-formed. For those cases where you have a service that can perform comprehensive verification, Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard also provides the ability to attach a service callback to trigger once the credit card number has been deemed valid; this callback will then be triggered, and its return value will determine overall validity. The following issuing institutes are accepted: American Express China UnionPay Diners Club Card Blanche Diners Club International Diners Club US and Canada Discover Card JCB Laser Maestro MasterCard Solo Visa Visa Electron Russia Mir Invalid institutes The institutes Bankcard and Diners Club enRoute no longer exist, and are treated as invalid. Switch has been rebranded to Visa and is therefore also treated as invalid. Supported options The following options are supported for Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard : service : A callback to an online service which will additionally be used for the validation. type : The type of credit card which will be validated. See the below list of institutes for details. Basic usage There are several credit card institutes which can be validated by Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard . Per default, all known institutes will be accepted. See the following example: $valid = new Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard(); if ($valid->isValid($input)) { // input appears to be valid } else { // input is invalid } The above example would validate against all known credit card institutes. Accepting only specific credit cards Sometimes it is necessary to accept only specific credit card institutes instead of all; e.g., when you have a webshop which accepts only Visa and American Express cards. Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard allows you to do exactly this by limiting it to exactly these institutes. To use a limitation you can either provide specific institutes at initiation, or afterwards by using setType() . Each can take several arguments. You can provide a single institute: use Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard; $valid = new CreditCard(CreditCard::AMERICAN_EXPRESS); When you want to allow multiple institutes, then you can provide them as array: use Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard; $valid = new CreditCard([ CreditCard::AMERICAN_EXPRESS, CreditCard::VISA ]); And, as with all validators, you can also pass an associative array of options or an instance of Traversable . In this case you have to provide the institutes with the type array key as demostrated here: use Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard; $valid = new CreditCard([ 'type' => [CreditCard::AMERICAN_EXPRESS] ]); You can also manipulate institutes after instantiation by using the methods setType() , addType() , and getType() . use Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard; $valid = new CreditCard(); $valid->setType([ CreditCard::AMERICAN_EXPRESS, CreditCard::VISA ]); Default institute When no institute is given at initiation then ALL will be used, which sets all institutes at once. In this case the usage of addType() is useless because all institutes are already added. Validation using APIs As said before Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard will only validate the credit card number. Fortunately, some institutes provide online APIs which can validate a credit card number by using algorithms which are not available to the public. Most of these services are paid services. Therefore, this check is deactivated per default. When you have access to such an API, then you can use it as an add on for Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard and increase the security of the validation. To do so, provide a callback to invoke when generic validation has passed.

The validator first splits the email address on local-part @ hostname and attempts to match these against known specifications for email addresses and hostnames. Basic usage A basic example of usage is below: $validator = new Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress(); if ($validator->isValid($email)) { // email appears to be valid } else { // email is invalid; print the reasons foreach ($validator->getMessages() as $message) { echo \"$message\\n\"; } } This will match the email address $email and on failure populate getMessages() with useful error messages. Supported Options Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress supports several options which can either be set at instantiation, by giving an array with the related options, or afterwards, by using setOptions() . The following options are supported: allow : Defines which type of domain names are accepted. This option is used in conjunction with the hostnameValidator option to set the hostname validator. Possible values of this option defined in Hostname validator's ALLOW_* constants: ALLOW_DNS (default) - Allows Internet domain names (e.g. example.com) ALLOW_IP - Allows IP addresses (e.g. 192.168.0.1) ALLOW_LOCAL - Allows local network such as localhost or www.localdomain ALLOW_URI - Allows hostnames in URI generic syntax. See RFC 3986 ALLOW_ALL - Allows all types of hostnames useDeepMxCheck : Defines if the servers MX records should be verified by a deep check. When this option is set to true then additionally to MX records also the A , A6 and AAAA records are used to verify if the server accepts emails. This option defaults to false . useDomainCheck : Defines if the domain part should be checked. When this option is set to false , then only the local part of the email address will be checked. In this case the hostname validator will not be called. This option defaults to true . hostnameValidator : Sets the hostname validator object instance with which the domain part of the email address will be validated. useMxCheck : Defines if the MX records from the server should be detected. If this option is defined to true then the MX records are used to verify if the server accepts emails. This option defaults to false . Complex local parts Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress will match any valid email address according to RFC2822. For example, valid emails include bob@domain.com , bob+jones@domain.us , \"bob@jones\"@domain.com* and \"bob jones\"@domain.com Some obsolete email formats will not currently validate (e.g. carriage returns or a \\\\ character in an email address). Validating only the local part If you need Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress to check only the local part of an email address, and want to disable validation of the hostname, you can set the domain option to false . This forces Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress not to validate the hostname part of the email address. $validator = new Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress(); $validator->setOptions(['domain' => FALSE]); Validating different types of hostnames The hostname part of an email address is validated against the Hostname validator . By default only DNS hostnames of the form domain.com are accepted, though if you wish you can accept IP addresses and Local hostnames too. To do this you need to instantiate Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress passing a parameter to indicate the type of hostnames you want to accept. More details are included in Zend\\Validator\\Hostname , though an example of how to accept both DNS and Local hostnames appears below: use Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress; use Zend\\Validator\\Hostname; $validator = new EmailAddress( Hostname::ALLOW_DNS | Hostname::ALLOW_LOCAL); if ($validator->isValid($email)) { // email appears to be valid } else { // email is invalid; print the reasons foreach ($validator->getMessages() as $message) { echo \"$message\\n\"; } } Checking if the hostname actually accepts email Just because an email address is in the correct format, it doesn't necessarily mean that email address actually exists. To help solve this problem, you can use MX validation to check whether an MX (email) entry exists in the DNS record for the email's hostname. This tells you that the hostname accepts email, but doesn't tell you the exact email address itself is valid. MX checking is not enabled by default. To enable MX checking you can pass a second parameter to the Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress constructor. $validator = new Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress([ 'allow' => Zend\\Validator\\Hostname::ALLOW_DNS, 'useMxCheck' => true, ]); Alternatively you can either pass true or false to setValidateMx() to enable or disable MX validation. By enabling this setting, network functions will be used to check for the presence of an MX record on the hostname of the email address you wish to validate. Please be aware this will likely slow your script down. Sometimes validation for MX records returns false , even if emails are accepted. The reason behind this behaviour is, that servers can accept emails even if they do not provide a MX record. In this case they can provide A , A6 , or AAAA records. To allow Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress to check also for these other records, you need to set deep MX validation. This can be done at initiation by setting the deep option or by using setOptions() . $validator = new Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress([ 'allow' => Zend\\Validator\\Hostname::ALLOW_DNS, 'useMxCheck' => true, 'useDeepMxCheck' => true, ]); Sometimes it can be useful to get the server's MX information which have been used to do further processing. Simply use getMXRecord() after validation. This method returns the received MX record including weight and sorted by it. Performance warning** You should be aware that enabling MX check will slow down you script because of the used network functions. Enabling deep check will slow down your script even more as it searches the given server for 3 additional types. Disallowed IP addresses You should note that MX validation is only accepted for external servers. When deep MX validation is enabled, then local IP addresses like 192.168.* or 169.254.* are not accepted. Validating International Domains Names Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress will also match international characters that exist in some domains. This is known as International Domain Name (IDN) support. This is enabled by default, though you can disable this by changing the setting via the internal Zend\\Validator\\Hostname object that exists within Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress . $validator->getHostnameValidator()->setValidateIdn(false); More information on the usage of setValidateIdn() appears in the Hostname documentation . Please note IDNs are only validated if you allow DNS hostnames to be validated. Validating Top Level Domains By default a hostname will be checked against a list of known TLDs. This is enabled by default, though you can disable this by changing the setting via the internal Zend\\Validator\\Hostname object that exists within Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress . $validator->getHostnameValidator()->setValidateTld(false); More information on the usage of setValidateTld() appears in the Hostname documentation .

Validating different types of hostnames You may find you also want to match IP addresses, Local hostnames, or a combination of all allowed types. This can be done by passing a parameter to Zend\\Validator\\Hostname when you instantiate it. The parameter should be an integer which determines what types of hostnames are allowed. You are encouraged to use the Zend\\Validator\\Hostname constants to do this. The Zend\\Validator\\Hostname constants are: ALLOW_DNS , to allow only DNS hostnames ALLOW_IP to allow IP addresses ALLOW_LOCAL to allow local network names ALLOW_URI to allow RFC3986 -compliant addresses ALLOW_ALL to allow all four above types Additional Information on ALLOW_URI ALLOW_URI allows checking hostnames according to RFC3986 . These are registered names which are used by WINS, NetInfo and also local hostnames like those defined within your hosts file. To check for IP addresses only, you can use the example below: use Zend\\Validator\\Hostname; $validator = new Hostname(Hostname::ALLOW_IP); if ($validator->isValid($hostname)) { // hostname appears to be valid } else { // hostname is invalid; print the reasons foreach ($validator->getMessages() as $message) { echo \"$message\\n\"; } } As well as using ALLOW_ALL to accept all common hostnames types, you can combine these types to allow for combinations. For example, to accept DNS and Local hostnames: use Zend\\Validator\\Hostname; $validator = new Hostname(Hostname::ALLOW_DNS | Hostname::ALLOW_IP); Validating International Domains Names Some Country Code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs), such as 'de' (Germany), support international characters in domain names. These are known as International Domain Names (IDN). These domains can be matched by Zend\\Validator\\Hostname via extended characters that are used in the validation process. At the time of writing, more than 50 ccTLDs support IDN domains. The Hostname validator matches IDN domains by default. If you wish to disable IDN validation, either pass a parameter to the Zend\\Validator\\Hostname constructor or call the setValidateIdn() method. You can disable IDN validation by passing a second parameter to the Zend\\Validator\\Hostname constructor in the following way. $validator = new Zend\\Validator\\Hostname([ 'allow' => Zend\\Validator\\Hostname::ALLOW_DNS, 'useIdnCheck' => false, ]); Alternatively you can either pass true or false to setValidateIdn() to enable or disable IDN validation. If you are trying to match an IDN hostname which isn't currently supported, it is likely it will fail validation if it has any international characters in it.

The default value is true . token : Sets the token against which the input will be validated. literal : If set to true , the validation will skip the lookup for elements in the form context, and validate the token just the way it was provided. The default value is false . Basic usage To validate if two values are identical, you need to set the original value as the token, as demonstrated in the following example: token. $valid = new Zend\\Validator\\Identical('origin'); if ($valid->isValid($value)) { return true; } The validation will only then return true when both values are 100% identical. In our example, when $value is 'origin' . You can set the token after instantiation by using the method setToken() . Identical objects Zend\\Validator\\Identical can validate not only strings, but any other variable type, such as booleans, integers, floats, arrays, or even objects. As already noted, the token and value must be identical. $valid = new Zend\\Validator\\Identical(123); if ($valid->isValid($input)) { // input appears to be valid } else { // input is invalid } Type comparison You should be aware of the variable type used for validation. This means that the string '3' is not identical to integer 3 . When you want non-strict validation, you must set the strict option to false . Form elements Zend\\Validator\\Identical supports the comparison of form elements. This can be done by using the element's name as the token : $form->add([ 'name' => 'elementOne', 'type' => 'Password', ]); $form->add([ 'name' => 'elementTwo', 'type' => 'Password', 'validators' => [ [ 'name' => 'Identical', 'options' => [ 'token' => 'elementOne', ], ], ], ]); By using the element's name from the first element as the token for the second element, the validator validates if the second element is equal with the first element. In the case your user does not enter two identical values, you will get a validation error. Validating a Value From a Fieldset Sometimes you will need to validate an input that lives inside a fieldset, and this can be accomplished as follows: use Zend\\Form\\Element; use Zend\\Form\\Fieldset; use Zend\\Form\\Form; use Zend\\InputFilter\\Input; use Zend\\InputFilter\\InputFilter; $userFieldset = new Fieldset('user'); // (1) $userFieldset->add([ 'name' => 'email', // (2) 'type' => 'Email', ]); // Let's add one fieldset inside the 'user' fieldset, // so we can see how to manage the token in a different deepness $deeperFieldset = new Fieldset('deeperFieldset'); // (3) $deeperFieldset->add([ 'name' => 'deeperFieldsetInput', // (4) 'type' => 'Text', 'options' => [ 'label' => 'What validator are we testing?', ], ]); $userFieldset->add($deeperFieldset); $signUpForm = new Form('signUp'); $signUpForm->add($userFieldset); // Add an input that will validate the 'email' input from 'user' fieldset $signUpForm->add([ 'name' => 'confirmEmail', // (5) 'type' => 'Email', ]); // Add an input that will validate the 'deeperFieldsetInput' from // 'deeperFieldset' that lives inside the 'user' fieldset $signUpForm->add([ 'name' => 'confirmTestingValidator', // (6) 'type' => 'Text', ]); // This will ensure the user enter the same email in 'email' (2) and // 'confirmEmail' (5) $inputFilter = new InputFilter(); $inputFilter->add([ 'name' => 'confirmEmail', // references (5) 'validators' => [ [ 'name' => 'Identical', 'options' => [ // 'user' key references 'user' fieldset (1), and 'email' // references 'email' element inside 'user' fieldset (2) 'token' => ['user' => 'email'], ], ], ], ]); // This will ensure the user enter the same string in 'deeperFieldsetInput' (4) // and 'confirmTestingValidator' (6) $inputFilter->add([ 'name' => 'confirmTestingValidator', // references (6) 'validators' => [ [ 'name' => 'Identical', 'options' => [ 'token' => [ 'user' => [ // references 'user' fieldset (1) // 'deeperFieldset' key references 'deeperFieldset' // fieldset (3); 'deeperFieldsetInput' references // 'deeperFieldsetInput' element (4) 'deeperFieldset' => 'deeperFieldsetInput', ], ], ], ], ], ]); $signUpForm->setInputFilter($inputFilter); Use one token per leaf Aways make sure that your token array have just one key per level all the way till the leaf, otherwise you can end up with unexpected results. Strict validation As mentioned before, Zend\\Validator\\Identical validates tokens using strict typing. You can change this behaviour by using the strict option. The default value for this property is true . $valid = new Zend\\Validator\\Identical(['token' => 123, 'strict' => false]); $input = '123'; if ($valid->isValid($input)) { // input appears to be valid } else { // input is invalid } The difference to the previous example is that the validation returns in this case true , even if you compare a integer with string value as long as the content is identical but not the type. For convenience you can also use setStrict() and getStrict() . Configuration As all other validators, Zend\\Validator\\Identical also supports the usage of configuration settings during instantiation. This means that you can configure this validator with a Traversable object. There is a case which you should be aware of. If you are using an array as token, and it contains a token key, you should wrap it within another token key. See the examples below to understand this situation. // This will not validate ['token' => 123], it will actually validate the // integer 123 $valid = new Zend\\Validator\\Identical(['token' => 123]); if ($valid->isValid($input)) { // input appears to be valid } else { // input is invalid } The reason for this special case is that you can configure the token which has to be used by giving the token key.

It is also able to validate multidimensional arrays. Supported options The following options are supported for Zend\\Validator\\InArray : haystack : Sets the haystack for the validation. recursive : Defines if the validation should be done recursively. This option defaults to false . strict : Three modes of comparison are offered owing to an often overlooked, and potentially dangerous security issue when validating string input from user input. InArray::COMPARE_STRICT : This is a normal in_array() strict comparison that checks value and type. InArray::COMPARE_NOT_STRICT : This is a normal in_array() non-strict comparison that checks value only, but not type. InArray::COMPARE_NOT_STRICT_AND_PREVENT_STR_TO_INT_VULNERABILTY : This operates in essentially the same way as InArray::COMPARE_NOT_STRICT , but ensures that strings are not cast to integer during comparison, preventing 0 == 'foo43' types of false positives. Use non-strict carefully Non-strict mode ( InArray::COMPARE_NOT_STRICT ) may give false positives when strings are compared against ints or floats owing to in_array() 's behaviour of converting strings to int in such cases. Therefore, 'foo' would become 0 , '43foo' would become 43 , while foo43' would also become 0 . Array validation Basic usage is to provide an array during instantiation: $validator = new Zend\\Validator\\InArray([ 'haystack' => ['value1', 'value2',...'valueN'], ]); if ($validator->isValid('value')) { // value found } else { // no value found } This will behave exactly like PHP's in_array() method when passed only a needle and haystack. Non-strict by default By default, this validation is not strict, nor can it validate multidimensional arrays. Alternately, you can define the array to validate against after object construction by using the setHaystack() method. getHaystack() returns the actual set haystack array. $validator = new Zend\\Validator\\InArray(); $validator->setHaystack(['value1', 'value2',...'valueN']); if ($validator->isValid('value')) { // value found } else { // no value found } Array validation modes As previously mentioned, there are possible security issues when using the default non-strict comparison mode, so rather than restricting the developer, we've chosen to offer both strict and non-strict comparisons, and add a safer middle-ground. It's possible to set the strict mode at initialisation and afterwards with the setStrict method. InArray::COMPARE_STRICT equates to true and InArray::COMPARE_NOT_STRICT_AND_PREVENT_STR_TO_INT_VULNERABILITY equates to false . // defaults to InArray::COMPARE_NOT_STRICT_AND_PREVENT_STR_TO_INT_VULNERABILITY $validator = new Zend\\Validator\\InArray([ 'haystack' => ['value1', 'value2', /* ... */ 'valueN'], ]); // set strict mode $validator = new Zend\\Validator\\InArray([ 'haystack' => ['value1', 'value2', /* ... */ 'valueN'], 'strict' => InArray::COMPARE_STRICT, // equates to ``true`` ]); // set non-strict mode $validator = new Zend\\Validator\\InArray([ 'haystack' => ['value1', 'value2', /* ... */ 'valueN'], 'strict' => InArray:COMPARE_NOT_STRICT, // equates to ``false`` ]); // or $validator->setStrict(InArray::COMPARE_STRICT); $validator->setStrict(InArray::COMPARE_NOT_STRICT); $validator->setStrict(InArray::COMPARE_NOT_STRICT_AND_PREVENT_STR_TO_INT_VULNERABILITY); Non-strict safe-mode by default Note that the strict setting is per default false . Recursive array validation In addition to PHP's in_array() method, this validator can also be used to validate multidimensional arrays. To validate multidimensional arrays you have to set the recursive option. $validator = new Zend\\Validator\\InArray([ 'haystack' => [ 'firstDimension' => ['value1', 'value2', / ... */ 'valueN'], 'secondDimension' => ['foo1', 'foo2', /* ... */ 'fooN'], ], 'recursive' => true, ]); if ($validator->isValid('value')) { // value found } else { // no value found } Your array will then be validated recursively to see if the given value is contained. Additionally you could use setRecursive() to set this option afterwards and getRecursive() to retrieve it. $validator = new Zend\\Validator\\InArray([ 'firstDimension' => ['value1', 'value2', /* ... */ 'valueN'], 'secondDimension' => ['foo1', 'foo2', /* ... */ 'fooN'], ]); $validator->setRecursive(true); if ($validator->isValid('value')) { // value found } else { // no value found } Default setting for recursion By default, the recursive validation is turned off.

By default, this validation is not activate and returns true on any float values. string : Returns false when an empty string '' is given. zero : Returns false when the single character zero ( '0' ) is given. empty_array : Returns false when an empty array is given. null : Returns false when a null value is given. php : Returns false on wherever PHP's empty() would return true . space : Returns false when an string is given which contains only whitespace. object : Returns true . false will be returned when object is not allowed but an object is given. object_string : Returns false when an object is given and its __toString() method returns an empty string. object_count : Returns false when an object is given, it implements Countable , and its count is 0. all : Returns false on all above types. All other given values will return true per default. There are several ways to select which of the above types are validated. You can give one or multiple types and add them, you can provide an array, you can use constants, or you can provide a textual string. See the following examples: use Zend\\Validator\\NotEmpty; // Returns false on 0 $validator = new NotEmpty(NotEmpty::INTEGER); // Returns false on 0 or '0' $validator = new NotEmpty( NotEmpty::INTEGER | NotEmpty::ZERO); // Returns false on 0 or '0' $validator = new NotEmpty([ NotEmpty::INTEGER, NotEmpty::ZERO ]); // Returns false on 0 or '0' $validator = new NotEmpty(['integer', 'zero']); You can also provide an instance of Traversable to set the desired types.
