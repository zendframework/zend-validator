It also provides a\nsimple validator chaining mechanism by which multiple validators may be applied\nto a single datum in a user-defined order.\n\n\nWhat is a validator?\n\n\nA validator examines its input with respect to some requirements and produces a\nboolean result indicating whether the input successfully validates against the\nrequirements. If the input does not meet the requirements, a validator may\nadditionally provide information about which requirement(s) the input does not\nmeet.\n\n\nFor example, a web application might require that a username be between six and\ntwelve characters in length, and may only contain alphanumeric characters. A\nvalidator can be used for ensuring that a username meets these requirements. If\na chosen username does not meet one or both of the requirements, it would be\nuseful to know which of the requirements the username fails to meet.\n\n\nBasic usage of validators\n\n\nHaving defined validation in this way provides the foundation for\n\nZend\\Validator\\ValidatorInterface\n, which defines two methods, \nisValid()\n and\n\ngetMessages()\n. The \nisValid()\n method performs validation upon the provided\nvalue, returning \ntrue\n if and only if the value passes against the validation\ncriteria.\n\n\nIf \nisValid()\n returns \nfalse\n, the \ngetMessages()\n method will return an array\nof messages explaining the reason(s) for validation failure. The array keys are\nshort strings that identify the reasons for validation failure, and the array\nvalues are the corresponding human-readable string messages. The keys and values\nare class-dependent; each validation class defines its own set of validation\nfailure messages and the unique keys that identify them. Each class also has a\n\nconst\n definition that matches each identifier for a validation failure cause.\n\n\n\n\nStateful validators\n\n\nThe \ngetMessages()\n methods return validation failure information only for the\nmost recent \nisValid()\n call. Each call to \nisValid()\n clears any messages and\nerrors caused by a previous \nisValid()\n call, because it's likely that each\ncall to \nisValid()\n is made for a different input value.\n\n\n\n\nThe following example illustrates validation of an e-mail address:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress;\n\n$validator = new EmailAddress();\n\nif ($validator->isValid($email)) {\n    // email appears to be valid\n} else {\n    // email is invalid; print the reasons\n    foreach ($validator->getMessages() as $messageId => $message) {\n        printf(\"Validation failure '%s': %s\\n\", $messageId, $message);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nCustomizing messages\n\n\nValidator classes provide a \nsetMessage()\n method with which you can specify the\nformat of a message returned by \ngetMessages()\n in case of validation failure.\nThe first argument of this method is a string containing the error message. You\ncan include tokens in this string which will be substituted with data relevant\nto the validator. The token \n%value%\n is supported by all validators; this is\nsubstituted with the value you passed to \nisValid()\n. Other tokens may be\nsupported on a case-by-case basis in each validation class. For example, \n%max%\n\nis a token supported by \nZend\\Validator\\LessThan\n. The \ngetMessageVariables()\n\nmethod returns an array of variable tokens supported by the validator.\n\n\nThe second optional argument is a string that identifies the validation failure\nmessage template to be set, which is useful when a validation class defines more\nthan one cause for failure. If you omit the second argument, \nsetMessage()\n\nassumes the message you specify should be used for the first message template\ndeclared in the validation class. Many validation classes only have one error\nmessage template defined, so there is no need to specify which message template\nyou are changing.\n\n\nuse Zend\\Validator\\StringLength;\n\n$validator = new StringLength(8);\n\n$validator->setMessage(\n    'The string \\'%value%\\' is too short; it must be at least %min% characters',\n    StringLength::TOO_SHORT\n);\n\nif (! $validator->isValid('word')) {\n    $messages = $validator->getMessages();\n    echo current($messages);\n\n    // \"The string 'word' is too short; it must be at least 8 characters\"\n}\n\n\n\nYou can set multiple messages using the \nsetMessages()\n method. Its argument is\nan array containing key/message pairs.\n\n\nuse Zend\\Validator\\StringLength;\n\n$validator = new StringLength(['min' => 8, 'max' => 12]);\n\n$validator->setMessages([\n    StringLength::TOO_SHORT => 'The string \\'%value%\\' is too short',\n    StringLength::TOO_LONG  => 'The string \\'%value%\\' is too long',\n]);\n\n\n\nIf your application requires even greater flexibility with which it reports\nvalidation failures, you can access properties by the same name as the message\ntokens supported by a given validation class. The \nvalue\n property is always\navailable in a validator; it is the value you specified as the argument of\n\nisValid()\n. Other properties may be supported on a case-by-case basis in each\nvalidation class.\n\n\nuse Zend\\Validator\\StringLength;\n\n$validator = new StringLength(['min' => 8, 'max' => 12]);\n\nif (! $validator->isValid('word')) {\n    printf(\n        \"Word failed: %s; its length is not between %d and %d\\n\",\n        $validator->value,\n        $validator->min,\n        $validator->max\n    );\n}\n\n\n\nTranslating messages\n\n\n\n\nTranslation compatibility\n\n\nIn versions 2.0 - 2.1, \nZend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator\n implemented\n\nZend\\I18n\\Translator\\TranslatorAwareInterface\n and accepted instances of\n\nZend\\I18n\\Translator\\Translator\n. Starting in version 2.2.0, zend-validator\nnow defines a translator interface, > \nZend\\Validator\\Translator\\TranslatorInterface\n,\nas well as it's own -aware variant, > \nZend\\Validator\\Translator\\TranslatorAwareInterface\n.\nThis was done to reduce dependencies for the component, and follows the\nprincipal of Separated Interfaces.\n\n\nThe upshot is that if you are migrating from a pre-2.2 version, and receiving\nerrors indicating that the translator provided does not implement\n\nZend\\Validator\\Translator\\TranslatorInterface\n, you will need to make a\nchange to your code.\n\n\nAn implementation of \nZend\\Validator\\Translator\\TranslatorInterface\n is\nprovided in \nZend\\Mvc\\I18n\\Translator\n, which also extends\n\nZend\\I18n\\Translator\\Translator\n. This version can be instantiated and used\njust as the original \nZend\\I18n\n version.\n\n\nA new service has also been registered with the MVC, \nMvcTranslator\n, which\nwill return this specialized, bridge instance.\n\n\nMost users should see no issues, as \nZend\\Validator\\ValidatorPluginManager\n\nhas been modified to use the \nMvcTranslator\n service internally, which is how\nmost developers were getting the translator instance into validators in the\nfirst place. You will only need to change code if you were manually injecting\nthe instance previously.\n\n\n\n\nValidator classes provide a \nsetTranslator()\n method with which you can specify\nan instance of \nZend\\Validator\\Translator\\TranslatorInterface\n which will\ntranslate the messages in case of a validation failure. The \ngetTranslator()\n\nmethod returns the translator instance. \nZend\\Mvc\\I18n\\Translator\n provides an\nimplementation compatible with the validator component.\n\n\nuse Zend\\Mvc\\I18n\\Translator;\nuse Zend\\Validator\\StringLength;\n\n$validator = new StringLength(['min' => 8, 'max' => 12]);\n$translate = new Translator();\n// configure the translator...\n\n$validator->setTranslator($translate);\n\n\n\nWith the static \nAbstractValidator::setDefaultTranslator()\n method you can set a\ninstance of \nZend\\Validator\\Translator\\TranslatorInterface\n which will be used\nfor all validation classes, and can be retrieved with \ngetDefaultTranslator()\n.\nThis prevents the need for setting a translator manually with each validator.\n\n\nuse Zend\\Mvc\\I18n\\Translator;\nuse Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator;\n\n$translate = new Translator();\n// configure the translator...\n\nAbstractValidator::setDefaultTranslator($translate);\n\n\n\nSometimes it is necessary to disable the translator within a validator. To\nachieve this you can use the \nsetDisableTranslator()\n method, which accepts a\nboolean parameter, and \nisTranslatorDisabled()\n to get the set value.\n\n\nuse Zend\\Validator\\StringLength;\n\n$validator = new StringLength(['min' => 8, 'max' => 12]);\nif (! $validator->isTranslatorDisabled()) {\n    $validator->setDisableTranslator();\n}\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to use a translator instead of setting own messages with\n\nsetMessage()\n.

The component allows this via\nimplementations of \nZend\\Validator\\ValidatorInterface\n.\n\n\nZend\\Validator\\ValidatorInterface\n defines two methods: \nisValid()\n and\n\ngetMessages()\n. An object that implements the interface may be added to a\nvalidator chain using \nZend\\Validator\\ValidatorChain::addValidator()\n. Such\nobjects may also be used with\n\nzend-inputfilter\n.\n\n\nValidators will return a boolean value from \nisValid()\n, and report information\nregarding \nwhy\n a value failed validation via \ngetMessages()\n. The\navailability of the reasons for validation failures may be valuable to an\napplication for various purposes, such as providing statistics for usability\nanalysis.\n\n\nBasic validation failure message functionality is implemented in\n\nZend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator\n, which you may extend for your custom\nvalidators.  Extending class you would implement the \nisValid()\n method logic\nand define the message variables and message templates that correspond to the\ntypes of validation failures that can occur. If a value fails your validation\ntests, then \nisValid()\n should return \nfalse\n. If the value passes your\nvalidation tests, then \nisValid()\n should return \ntrue\n.\n\n\nIn general, the \nisValid()\n method should not throw any exceptions, except where\nit is impossible to determine whether or not the input value is valid.

The following example illustrates how\nto write a class having independent validation rules, where the validation\nobject may return multiple reasons why a particular validation attempt failed.\n\n\nValidation with Independent Conditions, Multiple Reasons for Failure\n\n\nConsider writing a validation class for password strength enforcement - when a\nuser is required to choose a password that meets certain criteria for helping\nsecure user accounts. Let us assume that the password security criteria enforce\nthat the password:\n\n\n\n\nis at least 8 characters in length,\n\n\ncontains at least one uppercase letter,\n\n\ncontains at least one lowercase letter,\n\n\nand contains at least one digit character.\n\n\n\n\nThe following class implements these validation criteria:\n\n\nnamespace MyValid;\n\nuse Zend\\Validator\\AbstractValidator;\n\nclass PasswordStrength extends AbstractValidator\n{\n    const LENGTH = 'length';\n    const UPPER  = 'upper';\n    const LOWER  = 'lower';\n    const DIGIT  = 'digit';\n\n    protected $messageTemplates = [\n        self::LENGTH => \"'%value%' must be at least 8 characters in length\",\n        self::UPPER  => \"'%value%' must contain at least one uppercase letter\",\n        self::LOWER  => \"'%value%' must contain at least one lowercase letter\",\n        self::DIGIT  => \"'%value%' must contain at least one digit character\",\n    ];\n\n    public function isValid($value)\n    {\n        $this->setValue($value);\n\n        $isValid = true;\n\n        if (strlen($value) < 8) {\n            $this->error(self::LENGTH);\n            $isValid = false;\n        }\n\n        if (! preg_match('/[A-Z]/', $value)) {\n            $this->error(self::UPPER);\n            $isValid = false;\n        }\n\n        if (! preg_match('/[a-z]/', $value)) {\n            $this->error(self::LOWER);\n            $isValid = false;\n        }\n\n        if (! preg_match('/\\d/', $value)) {\n            $this->error(self::DIGIT);\n            $isValid = false;\n        }\n\n        return $isValid;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nNote that the four criteria tests in \nisValid()\n do not immediately return\n\nfalse\n. This allows the validation class to provide \nall\n of the reasons that\nthe input password failed to meet the validation requirements.

It is commonly used with\nsmall products where a UPCA barcode would not fit.\n\n\nSupported options\n\n\nThe following options are supported for \nZend\\Validator\\Barcode\n:\n\n\n\n\nadapter\n: Sets the barcode adapter which will be used. Supported are all\n  above noted adapters. When using a self defined adapter, then you have to set\n  the complete class name.\n\n\nchecksum\n: \nTRUE\n when the barcode should contain a checksum. The default\n  value depends on the used adapter. Note that some adapters don't allow to set\n  this option.\n\n\noptions\n: Defines optional options for a self written adapters.\n\n\n\n\nBasic usage\n\n\nTo validate if a given string is a barcode you must know its type. See the\nfollowing example for an EAN13 barcode:\n\n\n$valid = new Zend\\Validator\\Barcode('EAN13');\nif ($valid->isValid($input)) {\n    // input appears to be valid\n} else {\n    // input is invalid\n}\n\n\n\nOptional checksum\n\n\nSome barcodes can be provided with an optional checksum. These barcodes would be\nvalid even without checksum. Still, when you provide a checksum, then you should\nalso validate it. By default, these barcode types perform no checksum\nvalidation. By using the \nchecksum\n option you can define if the checksum will\nbe validated or ignored.\n\n\n$valid = new Zend\\Validator\\Barcode([\n    'adapter'  => 'EAN13',\n    'checksum' => false,\n]);\nif ($valid->isValid($input)) {\n    // input appears to be valid\n} else {\n    // input is invalid\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced security by disabling checksum validation\n\n\nBy switching off checksum validation you will also reduce the security of the\nused barcodes. Additionally you should note that you can also turn off the\nchecksum validation for those barcode types which must contain a checksum\nvalue. Barcodes which would not be valid could then be returned as valid even\nif they are not.\n\n\n\n\nWriting custom adapters\n\n\nYou may write custom barcode validators for usage with \nZend\\Validator\\Barcode\n;\nthis is often necessary when dealing with proprietary barcode types. To write\nyour own barcode validator, you need the following information.\n\n\n\n\nLength\n: The length your barcode must have. It can have one of the following\n  values:\n\n\nInteger\n: A value greater 0, which means that the barcode must have this\n    length.\n\n\n-1\n: There is no limitation for the length of this barcode.\n\n\n\"even\"\n: The length of this barcode must have a even amount of digits.\n\n\n\"odd\"\n: The length of this barcode must have a odd amount of digits.\n\n\narray\n: An array of integer values. The length of this barcode must have\n    one of the set array values.\n\n\nCharacters\n: A string which contains all allowed characters for this barcode.\n  Also the integer value 128 is allowed, which means the first 128 characters of\n  the ASCII table.\n\n\nChecksum\n: A string which will be used as callback for a method which does\n  the checksum validation.\n\n\n\n\nYour custom barcode validator must extend \nZend\\Validator\\Barcode\\AbstractAdapter\n\nor implement \nZend\\Validator\\Barcode\\AdapterInterface\n.\n\n\nAs an example, let's create a validator that expects an even number of\ncharacters that include all digits and the letters 'ABCDE', and which requires a\nchecksum.\n\n\nnamespace My\\Barcode;\n\nuse Zend\\Validator\\Barcode;\nuse Zend\\Validator\\Barcode\\AbstractAdapter;\n\nclass MyBar extends AbstractAdapter\n{\n    protected $length     = 'even';\n    protected $characters = '0123456789ABCDE';\n    protected $checksum   = 'mod66';\n\n    protected function mod66($barcode)\n    {\n        // do some validations and return a boolean\n    }\n}\n\n$valid = Barcode(MyBar::class);\nif ($valid->isValid($input)) {\n    // input appears to be valid\n} else {\n    // input is invalid\n}",

See the below list of\n  institutes for details.\n\n\n\n\nBasic usage\n\n\nThere are several credit card institutes which can be validated by\n\nZend\\Validator\\CreditCard\n. Per default, all known institutes will be accepted.\nSee the following example:\n\n\n$valid = new Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard();\nif ($valid->isValid($input)) {\n    // input appears to be valid\n} else {\n    // input is invalid\n}\n\n\n\nThe above example would validate against all known credit card institutes.\n\n\nAccepting only specific credit cards\n\n\nSometimes it is necessary to accept only specific credit card institutes instead\nof all; e.g., when you have a webshop which accepts only Visa and American\nExpress cards. \nZend\\Validator\\CreditCard\n allows you to do exactly this by\nlimiting it to exactly these institutes.\n\n\nTo use a limitation you can either provide specific institutes at initiation, or\nafterwards by using \nsetType()\n. Each can take several arguments.\n\n\nYou can provide a single institute:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard;\n\n$valid = new CreditCard(CreditCard::AMERICAN_EXPRESS);\n\n\n\nWhen you want to allow multiple institutes, then you can provide them as array:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard;\n\n$valid = new CreditCard([\n    CreditCard::AMERICAN_EXPRESS,\n    CreditCard::VISA\n]);\n\n\n\nAnd, as with all validators, you can also pass an associative array of options\nor an instance of \nTraversable\n. In this case you have to provide the institutes\nwith the \ntype\n array key as demostrated here:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard;\n\n$valid = new CreditCard([\n    'type' => [CreditCard::AMERICAN_EXPRESS]\n]);\n\n\n\nYou can also manipulate institutes after instantiation by using the methods\n\nsetType()\n, \naddType()\n, and \ngetType()\n.\n\n\nuse Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard;\n\n$valid = new CreditCard();\n$valid->setType([\n    CreditCard::AMERICAN_EXPRESS,\n    CreditCard::VISA\n]);\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault institute\n\n\nWhen no institute is given at initiation then \nALL\n will be used, which sets\nall institutes at once.\n\n\nIn this case the usage of \naddType()\n is useless because all institutes are\nalready added.\n\n\n\n\nValidation using APIs\n\n\nAs said before \nZend\\Validator\\CreditCard\n will only validate the credit card\nnumber. Fortunately, some institutes provide online APIs which can validate a\ncredit card number by using algorithms which are not available to the public.\nMost of these services are paid services. Therefore, this check is deactivated\nper default.\n\n\nWhen you have access to such an API, then you can use it as an add on for\n\nZend\\Validator\\CreditCard\n and increase the security of the validation.\n\n\nTo do so, provide a callback to invoke when generic validation has passed. This\nprevents the API from being called for invalid numbers, which increases the\nperformance of the application.\n\n\nsetService()\n sets a new service, and \ngetService()\n returns the set service.\nAs a configuration option, you can give the array key \nservice\n at instantiatio.\nFor details about possible options, read the\n\nCallback validator documentation\n.\n\n\nuse Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard;\n\n// Your service class\nclass CcService\n{\n    public function checkOnline($cardnumber, $types)\n    {\n        // some online validation\n    }\n}\n\n// The validation\n$service = new CcService();\n$valid   = new CreditCard(CreditCard::VISA);\n$valid->setService([$service, 'checkOnline']);\n\n\n\nThe callback method will be called with the credit card number as the first\nparameter, and the accepted types as the second parameter.",

For those cases where you have a service that can perform comprehensive\nverification,  Zend\\Validator\\CreditCard  also provides the ability to attach a\nservice callback to trigger once the credit card number has been deemed valid;\nthis callback will then be triggered, and its return value will determine\noverall validity.  The following issuing institutes are accepted:   American Express  China UnionPay  Diners Club Card Blanche  Diners Club International  Diners Club US and Canada  Discover Card  JCB  Laser  Maestro  MasterCard  Solo  Visa  Visa Electron  Russia Mir",

See \nRFC 3986\n\n\n\n\nALLOW_ALL\n - Allows all types of hostnames\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuseDeepMxCheck\n: Defines if the servers MX records should be verified by a deep check.\n  When this option is set to \ntrue\n then additionally to MX records also the \nA\n,\n  \nA6\n and \nAAAA\n records are used to verify if the server accepts emails. This\n  option defaults to \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\nuseDomainCheck\n: Defines if the domain part should be checked. When this option is\n  set to \nfalse\n, then only the local part of the email address will be checked.\n  In this case the hostname validator will not be called. This option defaults\n  to \ntrue\n.\n\n\nhostnameValidator\n: Sets the hostname validator object instance with which the\n  domain part of the email address will be validated.\n\n\nuseMxCheck\n: Defines if the MX records from the server should be detected. If this\n  option is defined to \ntrue\n then the MX records are used to verify if the\n  server accepts emails. This option defaults to \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\nComplex local parts\n\n\nZend\\Validator\\EmailAddress\n will match any valid email address according to\nRFC2822. For example, valid emails include \nbob@domain.com\n,\n\nbob+jones@domain.us\n, \n\"bob@jones\"@domain.com*\n and \n\"bob jones\"@domain.com\n\n\nSome obsolete email formats will not currently validate (e.g. carriage returns\nor a \n\\\\\n character in an email address).\n\n\nValidating only the local part\n\n\nIf you need \nZend\\Validator\\EmailAddress\n to check only the local part of an\nemail address, and want to disable validation of the hostname, you can set the\n\ndomain\n option to \nfalse\n. This forces \nZend\\Validator\\EmailAddress\n not to\nvalidate the hostname part of the email address.\n\n\n$validator = new Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress();\n$validator->setOptions(['domain' => FALSE]);\n\n\n\nValidating different types of hostnames\n\n\nThe hostname part of an email address is validated against the \nHostname validator\n.\nBy default only DNS hostnames of the form \ndomain.com\n are accepted, though if\nyou wish you can accept IP addresses and Local hostnames too.\n\n\nTo do this you need to instantiate \nZend\\Validator\\EmailAddress\n passing a\nparameter to indicate the type of hostnames you want to accept. More details are\nincluded in \nZend\\Validator\\Hostname\n, though an example of how to accept both\nDNS and Local hostnames appears below:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress;\nuse Zend\\Validator\\Hostname;\n\n$validator = new EmailAddress( Hostname::ALLOW_DNS | Hostname::ALLOW_LOCAL);\n\nif ($validator->isValid($email)) {\n    // email appears to be valid\n} else {\n    // email is invalid; print the reasons\n    foreach ($validator->getMessages() as $message) {\n        echo \"$message\\n\";\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nChecking if the hostname actually accepts email\n\n\nJust because an email address is in the correct format, it doesn't necessarily\nmean that email address actually exists. To help solve this problem, you can use\nMX validation to check whether an MX (email) entry exists in the DNS record for\nthe email's hostname. This tells you that the hostname accepts email, but\ndoesn't tell you the exact email address itself is valid.\n\n\nMX checking is not enabled by default. To enable MX checking you can pass a\nsecond parameter to the \nZend\\Validator\\EmailAddress\n constructor.\n\n\n$validator = new Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress([\n    'allow' => Zend\\Validator\\Hostname::ALLOW_DNS,\n    'useMxCheck'    => true,\n]);\n\n\n\nAlternatively you can either pass \ntrue\n or \nfalse\n to \nsetValidateMx()\n to\nenable or disable MX validation.\n\n\nBy enabling this setting, network functions will be used to check for the\npresence of an MX record on the hostname of the email address you wish to\nvalidate. Please be aware this will likely slow your script down.\n\n\nSometimes validation for MX records returns \nfalse\n, even if emails are\naccepted. The reason behind this behaviour is, that servers can accept emails\neven if they do not provide a MX record. In this case they can provide \nA\n,\n\nA6\n, or \nAAAA\n records. To allow \nZend\\Validator\\EmailAddress\n to check also\nfor these other records, you need to set deep MX validation. This can be done at\ninitiation by setting the \ndeep\n option or by using \nsetOptions()\n.\n\n\n$validator = new Zend\\Validator\\EmailAddress([\n    'allow' => Zend\\Validator\\Hostname::ALLOW_DNS,\n    'useMxCheck'    => true,\n    'useDeepMxCheck'  => true,\n]);\n\n\n\nSometimes it can be useful to get the server's MX information which have been\nused to do further processing. Simply use \ngetMXRecord()\n after validation. This\nmethod returns the received MX record including weight and sorted by it.\n\n\n\n\nPerformance warning**\n\n\nYou should be aware that enabling MX check will slow down you script because\nof the used network functions. Enabling deep check will slow down your script\neven more as it searches the given server for 3 additional types.\n\n\nDisallowed IP addresses\n\n\nYou should note that MX validation is only accepted for external servers. When\ndeep MX validation is enabled, then local IP addresses like \n192.168.*\n or\n\n169.254.*\n are not accepted.\n\n\n\n\nValidating International Domains Names\n\n\nZend\\Validator\\EmailAddress\n will also match international characters that\nexist in some domains. This is known as International Domain Name (IDN) support.\nThis is enabled by default, though you can disable this by changing the setting\nvia the internal \nZend\\Validator\\Hostname\n object that exists within\n\nZend\\Validator\\EmailAddress\n.\n\n\n$validator->getHostnameValidator()->setValidateIdn(false);\n\n\n\nMore information on the usage of \nsetValidateIdn()\n appears in the\n\nHostname documentation\n.\n\n\nPlease note IDNs are only validated if you allow DNS hostnames to be validated.\n\n\nValidating Top Level Domains\n\n\nBy default a hostname will be checked against a list of known TLDs. This is\nenabled by default, though you can disable this by changing the setting via the\ninternal \nZend\\Validator\\Hostname\n object that exists within\n\nZend\\Validator\\EmailAddress\n.\n\n\n$validator->getHostnameValidator()->setValidateTld(false);\n\n\n\nMore information on the usage of \nsetValidateTld()\n appears in the\n\nHostname documentation\n.\n\n\nPlease note TLDs are only validated if you allow DNS hostnames to be validated.\n\n\nSetting messages\n\n\nZend\\Validator\\EmailAddress\n makes also use of \nZend\\Validator\\Hostname\n to\ncheck the hostname part of a given email address.

These domains can be matched by \nZend\\Validator\\Hostname\n\nvia extended characters that are used in the validation process.\n\n\nAt the time of writing, more than 50 ccTLDs support IDN domains.\n\n\nThe \nHostname\n validator matches IDN domains by default.  If you wish to disable\nIDN validation, either pass a parameter to the \nZend\\Validator\\Hostname\n\nconstructor or call the \nsetValidateIdn()\n method.\n\n\nYou can disable IDN validation by passing a second parameter to the\n\nZend\\Validator\\Hostname\n constructor in the following way.\n\n\n$validator = new Zend\\Validator\\Hostname([\n    'allow' => Zend\\Validator\\Hostname::ALLOW_DNS,\n    'useIdnCheck'   => false,\n]);\n\n\n\nAlternatively you can either pass \ntrue\n or \nfalse\n to \nsetValidateIdn()\n to\nenable or disable IDN validation. If you are trying to match an IDN hostname\nwhich isn't currently supported, it is likely it will fail validation if it has\nany international characters in it. Where a ccTLD file doesn't exist in\n\nZend/Validator/Hostname\n specifying the additional characters, a normal hostname\nvalidation is performed.\n\n\nPlease note that IDNs are only validated if you allow DNS hostnames to be\nvalidated.\n\n\nValidating Top Level Domains\n\n\nBy default, a hostname will be verified against a list of known TLDs. If this\nfunctionality is not required, it can be disabled in much the same way as\ndisabling IDN support.

The default value is \ntrue\n.\n\n\ntoken\n: Sets the token against which the input will be validated.\n\n\nliteral\n: If set to \ntrue\n, the validation will skip the lookup for elements\n  in the form context, and validate the token just the way it was provided. The\n  default value is \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\nBasic usage\n\n\nTo validate if two values are identical, you need to set the original value as\nthe token, as demonstrated in the following example:\ntoken.\n\n\n$valid = new Zend\\Validator\\Identical('origin');\n\nif ($valid->isValid($value)) {\n    return true;\n}\n\n\n\nThe validation will only then return \ntrue\n when both values are 100% identical.\nIn our example, when \n$value\n is \n'origin'\n.\n\n\nYou can set the token after instantiation by using the method \nsetToken()\n.\n\n\nIdentical objects\n\n\nZend\\Validator\\Identical\n can validate not only strings, but any other variable\ntype, such as booleans, integers, floats, arrays, or even objects. As already\nnoted, the token and value must be identical.\n\n\n$valid = new Zend\\Validator\\Identical(123);\n\nif ($valid->isValid($input)) {\n    // input appears to be valid\n} else {\n    // input is invalid\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nType comparison\n\n\nYou should be aware of the variable type used for validation. This means that\nthe string \n'3'\n is not identical to integer \n3\n. When you want non-strict\nvalidation, you must set the \nstrict\n option to \nfalse\n.\n\n\n\n\nForm elements\n\n\nZend\\Validator\\Identical\n supports the comparison of form elements. This can be\ndone by using the element's name as the \ntoken\n:\n\n\n$form->add([\n    'name' => 'elementOne',\n    'type' => 'Password',\n]);\n$form->add([\n    'name'       => 'elementTwo',\n    'type'       => 'Password',\n    'validators' => [\n        [\n            'name'    => 'Identical',\n            'options' => [\n                'token' => 'elementOne',\n            ],\n        ],\n    ],\n]);\n\n\n\nBy using the element's name from the first element as the \ntoken\n for the second\nelement, the validator validates if the second element is equal with the first\nelement. In the case your user does not enter two identical values, you will get\na validation error.\n\n\nValidating a Value From a Fieldset\n\n\nSometimes you will need to validate an input that lives inside a fieldset, and\nthis can be accomplished as follows:\n\n\nuse Zend\\Form\\Element;\nuse Zend\\Form\\Fieldset;\nuse Zend\\Form\\Form;\nuse Zend\\InputFilter\\Input;\nuse Zend\\InputFilter\\InputFilter;\n\n$userFieldset = new Fieldset('user'); // (1)\n$userFieldset->add([\n    'name' => 'email', // (2)\n    'type' => 'Email',\n]);\n\n// Let's add one fieldset inside the 'user' fieldset,\n// so we can see how to manage the token in a different deepness\n$deeperFieldset = new Fieldset('deeperFieldset'); // (3)\n$deeperFieldset->add([\n    'name'    => 'deeperFieldsetInput', // (4)\n    'type'    => 'Text',\n    'options' => [\n        'label' => 'What validator are we testing?',\n    ],\n]);\n$userFieldset->add($deeperFieldset);\n\n$signUpForm = new Form('signUp');\n$signUpForm->add($userFieldset);\n\n// Add an input that will validate the 'email' input from 'user' fieldset\n$signUpForm->add([\n    'name' => 'confirmEmail', // (5)\n    'type' => 'Email',\n]);\n\n// Add an input that will validate the 'deeperFieldsetInput' from\n// 'deeperFieldset' that lives inside the 'user' fieldset\n$signUpForm->add([\n    'name' => 'confirmTestingValidator', // (6)\n    'type' => 'Text',\n]);\n\n// This will ensure the user enter the same email in 'email' (2) and\n// 'confirmEmail' (5)\n$inputFilter = new InputFilter();\n$inputFilter->add([\n    'name' => 'confirmEmail', // references (5)\n    'validators' => [\n        [\n            'name' => 'Identical',\n            'options' => [\n                // 'user' key references 'user' fieldset (1), and 'email'\n                // references 'email' element inside 'user' fieldset (2)\n                'token' => ['user' => 'email'],\n            ],\n        ],\n    ],\n]);\n\n// This will ensure the user enter the same string in 'deeperFieldsetInput' (4)\n// and 'confirmTestingValidator' (6)\n$inputFilter->add([\n    'name' => 'confirmTestingValidator', // references (6)\n    'validators' => [\n        [\n            'name' => 'Identical',\n            'options' => [\n                'token' => [\n                    'user' => [ // references 'user' fieldset (1)\n                        // 'deeperFieldset' key references 'deeperFieldset'\n                        // fieldset (3); 'deeperFieldsetInput' references\n                        // 'deeperFieldsetInput' element (4)\n                        'deeperFieldset' => 'deeperFieldsetInput',\n                    ],\n                ],\n            ],\n        ],\n    ],\n]);\n\n$signUpForm->setInputFilter($inputFilter);\n\n\n\n\n\nUse one token per leaf\n\n\nAways make sure that your token array have just one key per level all the way\ntill the leaf, otherwise you can end up with unexpected results.\n\n\n\n\nStrict validation\n\n\nAs mentioned before, \nZend\\Validator\\Identical\n validates tokens using strict\ntyping. You can change this behaviour by using the \nstrict\n option. The default\nvalue for this property is \ntrue\n.\n\n\n$valid = new Zend\\Validator\\Identical(['token' => 123, 'strict' => false]);\n$input = '123';\nif ($valid->isValid($input)) {\n    // input appears to be valid\n} else {\n    // input is invalid\n}\n\n\n\nThe difference to the previous example is that the validation returns in this\ncase \ntrue\n, even if you compare a integer with string value as long as the\ncontent is identical but not the type.\n\n\nFor convenience you can also use \nsetStrict()\n and \ngetStrict()\n.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nAs all other validators, \nZend\\Validator\\Identical\n also supports the usage of\nconfiguration settings during instantiation. This means that you can configure\nthis validator with a \nTraversable\n object.\n\n\nThere is a case which you should be aware of. If you are using an array as\ntoken, and it contains a \ntoken\n key, you should wrap it within another\n\ntoken\n key. See the examples below to undestand this situation.\n\n\n// This will not validate ['token' => 123], it will actually validate the\n// integer 123\n$valid = new Zend\\Validator\\Identical(['token' => 123]);\nif ($valid->isValid($input)) {\n    // input appears to be valid\n} else {\n    // input is invalid\n}\n\n\n\nThe reason for this special case is that you can configure the token which has\nto be used by giving the \ntoken\n key.\n\n\nSo, when you are using an array as the token, and it contains one element with a\n\ntoken\n key, then you have to wrap it as shown in the example below:\n\n\n// Unlike the previous example, this will validate ['token' => 123]\n$valid = new Zend\\Validator\\Identical(['token' => ['token' => 123]]);\nif ($valid->isValid($input)) {\n    // input appears to be valid\n} else {\n    // input is invalid\n}\n\n\n\nIf the array you are willing to validate does not have a \ntoken\n key, you do not\nneed to wrap it.",
